# The Notion of Semantic Frames in Transformer Models: Application to Lexical Typology Study


This is the code of the term paper project in HSE university. 

The repository contains 4 notebooks that can be launched in Google Colab. Directories contain all the necessary data. 

  1. **Data preprocessing:** Extracting the sentences with target words from Taiga corpus and Subject/Verb/Object extraction. 
  2. **Vectorization:** Preliminary experiments with semantic field classification. Probing of different transformer-based models.
  3. **Clustering:** Clustering of LaBSE embeddings for Russian and test Swedish dataset with different algorithms.
  4. **Trasfer:** Translation of the dataset from Russsan to Swedish and sentence-embeddings clustering.
  5. **Alignment:** Sentence alignment and verb extraction

Theoretical background data can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WoHV1bv3csVzHUutqzrw01lTxhHqgYmIWKYrVrQiHjg/edit?usp=sharing).
